- <p>"The aggregation of marginal gains" is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. We tend to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.</p>

- <p>It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.</p>

- <p>Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.</p>

- <p>Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. "When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before."</p>

- <p>Forget about goals, focus on systems instead. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.Winners and losers have the same goals.</p>

- <p>Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning. True behavior change is identity change.</p>

- <p>The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.</p>

- <p>The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.</p>

- <p>
    1) Decide the type of person you want to be.<br>
    2) Prove it to yourself with small wins</p>

- <p>Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want? Who is the type of person that could run a successful start-up?"</p>

- <p>The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.</p>
