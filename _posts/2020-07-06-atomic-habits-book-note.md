- <p>"The aggregation of marginal gains" is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. We tend to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.</p>

- <p>It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.</p>

- <p>Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.</p>

- <p>Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. "When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before."</p>

- <p>Forget about goals, focus on systems instead. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.Winners and losers have the same goals.</p>

- <p>Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning. True behavior change is identity change.</p>

- <p>The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.</p>

- <p>The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.</p>

- <p>
    1) Decide the type of person you want to be.<br>
    2) Prove it to yourself with small wins</p>

- <p>Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want? Who is the type of person that could run a successful start-up?"</p>

- <p>The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.</p>

- <p>Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. Our brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.</p>

- <p>It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity. Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future.</p>

- <p>Research shows that people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write more,” but we never say when and where these habits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that we will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the right time.</p>

- <p>Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.</p>

- <p>Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course.</p>

- <p>We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear enough about what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why.</p>

- <p>One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.</p>

- <p>Example: Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute.</p>

- <p>The secret to creating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.</p>
