> <i>The following notes represent my personal interpretation of the week one module of Coursera's Machine Learning course presented by Andrew Ng for my own future reference.</i>

Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.
Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Example: playing checkers.
<pre style="font-size: 15px;">
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers.
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
</pre>

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
